        "description": "There are few places left as naturally and untouched as Reflections Wee Jasper campgrounds, a true escape into nature. This laid-back camping escape in country NSW is dog-friendly and has everything you need for an outdoor adventure. World-class hiking, walking, waterfalls, paddling and fishing are all in abundance. It\u2019s about as wild as it gets, all with warm showers and flushing toilets!\n\nWhether you\u2019re hanging out with family, friends, or your furry pals, Wee Jasper has got you covered with its unmarked, bush camping. Our park is all about getting amongst the great outdoors. With space a-plenty, there\u2019s heaps of room to spread out and soak up the fresh air or explore the surroundings, if that's your thing.\n\nSituated at the track head to the iconic Hume and Hovell Walking Track\u2019s most interesting section, it's a haven for bushwalking, birdwatching and hiking. Caving is also on the agenda with Carey\u2019s Caves a few kilometres up the road. Our rustic facilities cater to groups big and small, making camping a breeze. Fire up the BBQ for some alfresco cooking, while the kids explore. Then after dinner, enjoy the simple pleasure of roasting marshmallows over the firepit, followed by a night of stargazing \u2013 not a bad way to drift off to sleep.\n\nThere are four separate reserves at Reflections Wee Jasper \u2013 all within five minutes drive from each other. Three are on the river with Fitzpatrick Reserve at the Trailhead (of the same name) of The Hume and Hovell. These sites are perfect for whatever way you like to camp from caravans to tents, and are also perfect for extra large vans as the sites are unmarked, so you and the family can truly spread out.\n\nFor an authentic Aussie camping experience where the focus is on good times and making memories, camping at Reflections Wee Campgrounds is the spot.\n\nPlus we can't forget the most crucial member of your family, yes your furry friends are welcome at the park. Please call the park to book in, with a dog.\n\nAll campers please book your accommodation at Billy Grace Reserve.  Billy Grace accepts bookings for;\n\n - Billy Grace Reserve\n - Fitzpatrick Trackhead Reserve\n - Micalong Creek Reserve\n - Swinging Bridge Reserve\n",

Visitors can explore the deep history of Cobar in the all-new exhibitions while admiring the restored beauty of the grand old building. The exhibitions tell a story of mining, people, pastoralism, community and hard work that starts thousands of years ago and leads to the near past. There is something for everyone to marvel at, whether it is the gold gleaming in the rock, or the evidence of hard work put in by miners, farmers and womenfolk. There are tales of a bushranger turned respectable businessman, of the ingenuity of the indigenous people, and of the fun everyone had when the hard work was done for the day. After going through the museum, visitors can buy a souvenir in the small but well-stocked shop. The friendly staff will provide maps and information about the area and your next destination.",

Its certainly a time of new life around here \u20ac\u201c its also the season youll hear frogs singing by the water. All year round, youre likely to see kangaroos and wallabies near the campsite. Sit quietly by the waterholes at dusk and you might also see a platypus.",

        "description": "Long Gully campground, like Budawang in general, is one for experienced travellers. Located on a grassy flat beside Yadboro River, surrounded by blackbutt trees and rising steeply on the northern side, this is a place you come to get away from everything. Facilities are minimal \u20ac\u201c pit toilets and picnic tables, with no marked sites \u20ac\u201c but the sort of person who comes here is self-sufficient and hardy. Plus, the scenery is spectacular.Bring the tent, firewood, and enough food to last (water can be collected from the river and boiled), then settle down in scenic solitude. The remoteness of Long Gully means your closest neighbours are likely to be goannas and wallabies, though there is an adjacent picnic area. Avid bushwalkers will want to pack their hiking boots and compass as well for an exhilarating walk in the Budawang backcountry. The arduous trek to the Castle also begins from here, suitable for well-equipped adventurers only.Wherever you end up, return to a refreshing splash in Yadboro, though better swimming opportunities can be found in nearby Clyde River.

The trail is unmarked and there are areas where rock-hopping is necessary, but this is bushwalking at its best. It takes about 2.5 hours to get to the waterfall and back.Getting to the campground is easy from Glen Innes or Inverell, but you do need to carry gear along a walking track from the carpark.",

Within easy walking distance of the campground are fishing, swimming and hiking opportunities, along with plenty of chances to entertain a little birdwatching you might even spot a wedge-tailed eagle circling above your camping spot. If privacy is what you're after, bring some hiking boots and follow Junction walk, a four-kilometre trail from the campground which takes you to the junction of Severn and Macintyre rivers. Several small, secluded beaches are tucked between the rocks, with calm water ideal for a refreshing dip. Lemon Tree Flat offers tank water suitable for drinking after treatment, though its also a good idea to bring your own as well.",

Fewer people visit this campground compared to the well-known Wanda Wandong, which means you can quite often have the campground all to yourself; perfect for picnicking.\n\nWallabies and kangaroos are often seen in the campground during the day. \n\nBirdwatching is very rewarding as you are likely to see parrots, including the glossy black cockatoo, eastern rosella and little lorikeet, flying overhead, while kookaburras, kingfishers, thornbills, robins and treecreepers may be seen flying between the trees within the campground. \n\nWhen there is water in the creek, several different species of frogs can be heard calling out at night.",

However, youre more likely to see flame robins and Richards pipets among the trees, and grazing red-necked wallabies.Walk or cycle to spectacular Careys Peak lookout or plan your bushwalk via Link trail \u20ac\u201c Gloucester Tops to Careys Peak.

Offering camping a short walk from Culgoa River (which is often dry), this scenic spot doubles as a place to picnic, making it a perfect break from road touring or adventure hiking.Spring and autumn are ideal times to settle down in tranquil silence surrounded by gidgee trees and vibrant red soil. Culgoa River campground is remote without being isolated, offering you the best of both worlds. Be sure to pack an ample supply of food and water, and then forget about everything and revel in the solitude, with parrots and waterbirds brushing through the cypress pines above and grey kangaroos foraging around the shrubs below.Between birdwatching, fishing and relaxing, you might like to take advantage of the nearby day walks, with several easy tracks leading through the scenic pines or along the river bank. A good place to start is Mirri Mirri Yurun (River Bank walk).",

        "description": "When you really want to escape and recharge, try peaceful riverside camping at Lake Yarrunga. Starting from Talllow Dam, launch your canoe or kayak and paddle east (downstream) through towering sandstone cliffs and patches of forest.Its an ideal flat water kayaking adventure for beginner paddlers and families because there are no powered boats or rapids. This area was once a \u20ac\u02dcwild river and was dammed to provide water for Sydney and Nowra.Spend your days on the water meandering through the creeks, tributaries and gorges. Azure kingfishers can be seen close to waters edge all year round and you might spot water dragons diving off into the water when they have company. Wake up to birdsong and catch the sunrise before paddling back to civilisation.",

        "description": "Washpools campground is Towarris established camping area. Park your caravan or pitch your tent beside Middle Brook and enjoy spending time relaxing in this gorgeous natural setting. The viewing platform for scenic views is closeby, and Washpools waterhole is only 500m away. For those who want to explore the park further, use the campground as a base and hike the park from there. Enjoy a campfire in the winter months.Staying overnight in Towarri means you might spot birds and animals that are generally out after the sun sets. The powerful owl will be hunting medium-sized tree-dwelling creatures after dark. The ringtail and brushy tail possums are nocturnal, travelling up through the air between branches (sometimes to escape those owls). Wombats tend to take to wandering when the sun has disappeared from the sky. So strap on a headlamp and see what else is near your camp.",

A spectacular lookout is right nearby as well: Finchley Trig, framing Mount Yengo in the distance. Dont forget the camera.One of the campgrounds best offerings is not apparent until nightfall though, when the lack of light pollution leaves the sky open to an unparalleled vista of the stars.

Bring your kayak or canoe if you wantto paddle upstream \u20ac\u201c and see if you can hook a catch to barbecue back at camp for dinner.Spring and Autumn are beautiful times of the year to camp, when visitation is low and the weather is beautiful. But be prepared nights can be chilly so pack a jumper. Youll be sharing the space with resident wildlife, and if youre lucky (and patient) you might even spot a platypus in the river.",

        "description": "Burralow Creek campground and picnic area is nestled beside Burralow Creek, in the Lower Grose Valley area of Blue Mountains National Park. Set up camp on the grass, surrounded by native scribbly gums and a natural sandstone amphitheatre.This peaceful spot is popular with families and groups of friends looking for a remote bush escape close to Sydney.  There's plenty of space for the kids to roam free.From your tent, take an easy bushwalk past a convict-dug pit, along the creek and through a small rainforest gully to Bulcamatta Falls. The nearby Burralow peat swamps provide habitat for the nationally endangered giant dragonfly in summer, and keen birdwatchers should keep an eye out for the rare glossy black cockatoo.Cook up a barbecue feast for dinner and see if you can spot the nightlife, including swamp wallabies, sugar gliders, brushtail and ringtail possums, and several species of owl. Then settle in and watch the night sky fill with stars.\n\nThe fire trail access to this campground is recommended for 4WD vehicles only.\nSites are unmarked.\nThis campground is in a remote location, so it\u2019s a good idea to pick up your supplies before you arrive.",

Found right by the riverbank and surrounded by gum trees, the campground might be easy to reach from town, but once you arrive, the sense of solitude makes it feel miles away from civilisation. Outside of school holidays and long weekends, you can often have the entire area to yourself.Bring a tent and pass a long weekend fishing and swimming in the river, or bring a mountain bike and hiking boots and use it as a base for exploring further afield. The campground caters to the very active, day-trippers looking for a picnic spot, and visitors who are simply scouting for somewhere to kick back in serene nature. And nature is everywhere: kangaroos, wallabies and emus like to forage in the undergrowth, while native birds roost in the trees, so dont forget your binoculars if birdwatching is an interest.During winter, the campground also offers a great \u20ac\u201c and warmer \u20ac\u201c alternative to Jindabyne and the ski resorts, and the area blooms with stunning wildflowers.",

Theyre best spotted either as the sun rises or sets. If youre here during spring \u20ac\u201c a beautiful time to visit Abercrombie River \u20ac\u201c look for the pretty yellow and red pea flowers (also called bacon and egg flowers) and the beautifully scented white blooms of the tea tree.",

        "description": "If camping in remote, unspoilt beauty surrounded by dramatic landforms while neighbouring the beautiful Nymboida River appeals, point your 4WD towards Nymboida River campground. Push your canoe out into the river, or take a summer dip while listening for the distinctive chink of the bellbirds. There are no marked tracks, but experienced bushwalkers will love the wild beauty of Nymboida. This is a quiet campground and you may well have the place to yourself.Even getting theres an adventure. Old Glen Innes-Grafton Road passes through a historic hand-cut tunnel into the stillness of the deserted valley. Cast your imagination into the past and you may hear the snap of the reins on the Cobb & Co. coach team, the thud of the timber getters axe, or the cry of the bullocky hauling down the track to Clarence River.",

The legacy of this is plenty of space, caravan sites and tents are easily accommodated here. But the rugged terrain across most of the park has ensured that most of its plant life is relatively undisturbed: you may be in a man-made clearing, but all around you are tranquil pockets of wet sclerophyll forest and dry rainforest on rocky scree slopes. Wake up to the comforting sounds of nature, with the endless gurgle of Manning River right alongside your site.\n\nFamilies love this campground and its easy to understand why. As well as tables and free barbecues offering terrific picnicking opportunities, river camping means a chance to swim freely, or float along the current on a lilo. \n\nYou can then stretch out on the grass to dry off in the warming sun. Its hard to think of anything better on a summers afternoon, but if youre interested in walking, bring the hiking boots, the short but enjoyable Brush Turkey track leaves right from the campground.",

Barbecues make this a great picnic spot for a Sunday rest, too, with lots of grass to accommodate everyone.The area is named after Bill Mulligan, an early entrepreneur who promoted a hydro-electric scheme in the early 1900s. You can still glimpse Mulligans hut and the remains of two historic weirs as you relax by the waters edge.Like Gibraltar House, this is a perfect spot to delve into other national parks and reserves in the area, including Butterleaf, Mann River, Nymboida and Capoompeta.",

        "description": "The small Bungarie Bay campground is a peaceful spot nestled by the shores of Boolambayte Lake, a short drive from Bulahdelah. The 7 campsites are surrounded by tall casuarina and paperbark forest, with stunning views across the lake.The campground is a great base to enjoy swimming and paddling during the warmer months. If you're into water sports or want to fish in nearby Myall Lake, there's a boat ramp and wharf up the road at Violet Hill campground and picnic area.Boolambayte Lake is a bird watcher's paradise and is part of the Myall Lakes system, which is internationally recognised as a protected Ramsar Wetland. Sit back and watch huge flocks of black swans erupt from the water, or try to spot rare waterbirds like the black-necked stork or wompoo fruit dove.The surrounding forest is also full of wildlife, so keep an eye out for koalas, swamp wallabies, echidnas and even dingoes. In the evening, light a campfire and keep your eyes peeled for possums, owls and bandicoots that come out after dusk.",

The hike in, along Canoelands Ridge walking track, offers stunning views of sandstone ridges and the Hawkesbury River. Once you arrive, it's time to relax by the river, spot sea eagles and wedge-tail eagles soaring above the trees, and catch a glimpse of lyrebirds and bandicoots who often visit at dusk and dawn.Gentlemans Halt is also a great place to explore by water. Paddle in by kayak or canoe, or anchor your boat and enjoy a night sleeping under the stars in this back-to-basics campground, north of Sydney. It's believed that Governor Phillip camped at Gentlemans Halt in 1789 during his explorations of Hawkesbury River. Today, you'll find it much the same - picturesque and remote bushland with great views across the river, and not a soul in sight.",

Enjoy the cool shade of the swamp gums, which bear cream flowers during spring, and soak up the solitude. Located on Hume and Hovell walking trail, this secluded campground is often frequented by those hiking the Yass\u20ac\u201cAlbury track.You might also encounter some other locals: wallabies, wombats and echidnas can all be seen in the area. Noisy gang-gang cockatoos and different species of parrots rest in the trees and feed on the flowers, so get those birdwatching binoculars out. Nocturnal animals, including gliders, live high in the branches and become active as the sun sets, and you might hear the deep hoots of the endangered powerful owls during the night.",

        "description": "Situated in a wide grassy area next to the Kedumba River, this walk-in campground is ideal for self-sufficient campers. Once part of the pioneering Maxwell Farm, Kedumba River Crossing campground lies in the heart of the Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area.From Katoomba, the campground is a 15.5km walk along the multi-day Mount Solitary walking track. You can also reach the campground via a 9km walk down Kedumba Pass, along Kedumba Valley fire trail, near Wentworth Falls. Both walks have very steep and arduous descents and ascents so take enough water and food. At the bottom of the valley, intrepid campers will find plenty of flat campsites to choose from, as well as toilets, picnic tables, and fire rings for a barbecue and bush tea. It takes 2 to 3 hours to hike down and 3 to 4 hours to hike back out. Once youve set up camp for the night, enjoy the peaceful surrounds, including breathtaking views of Mount Solitary, the Katoomba escarpment and Kings Tableland. At sunset, the sandstone walls glow gold, and on a clear night the Milky Way shines bright.Be sure to check out heritage-listed Maxwells Hut, the original Maxwell family homestead, and keep an eye out for red-necked wallabies and wombats. At dawn and dusk you might see platypus in the river, near the majestic stand of rare Camden white gums.",

From the parks main entrance off Webbs Creek Road, its a tough but rewarding ride for most mountain bikers and cyclists.Set up camp in this remote site and keep an eye out for gliders and possums in the eucalypts as the sun sets. During the day, lyrebirds can often be spotted loitering around the bracken fern near your campsite. Its also not unusual to be woken by a chorus of kookaburras.When the wildflowers are out during spring, try identifying some of those growing around your campsite. Theres the mountain devil (red, of course), the pale pink flowers of eriostemon, the soft white-petal flannel flower and grey spider flower, which is a type of grevillia.",

Willing hikers will want to find their own path around the swamp, which takes about 90 minutes and is suitable for experienced walkers (no signage provided). The journey here is part of the attraction, too: if youre 4WD touring, approach via Panhandle fire trail for breathtaking views across Tia Valley.An afternoon by New Country Swamp is perfect for birdwatching, with fan-tailed cuckoos, pardolotes, and yellow robins hanging around in spring and summer. The kids will love the wallabies and wombats. At night, as you sit around the campfire, boobooks and sooty owls provide a nocturnal chorus for your campfire songs.",

It follows the Severn River past picnic areas and small beaches to the junction with the McIntyre River. Enjoy swimming and fishing, then continue to Dungeon lookout, where youll have views over the steep river gorge and canopy of white cypress pines.After lunch, grab your binoculars and go birdwatching. Youll see speckled warblers and thornbills by the river, as well the stunning turquoise feathers of the sacred kingfisher. At dusk, brush tailed possums and squirrel gliders dart among the river oaks. If youre lucky, youll spot a small southern boobook owl perched on nearby branch.If you dont like the heat, make sure you visit in the cooler months. Theres little shade at the campground and summer temperatures can reach 40\u00b0C. The campground is positioned well to enjoy the winter sunshine. From September to March, wildflowers bloom in the surrounding woodlands.",

Remote, quiet and peaceful, you can relax and reconnect with nature.Set up your tent, caravan or camper trailer among the trees, and enjoy your meals on the shaded picnic tables. During the day head off on a walk through the bush, keeping your eyes open for emus, red kangaroos and eastern grey kangaroos as they roam among the vegetation. And at night look to the sky and take in the impressive view of the stars, thanks to the minimal light pollution.Spring and autumn are great times to visit, as you avoid the hot summer days and cold winter nights. Winter has its own charm though, as you cosy up around the campfire and admire the cold nights, which can sometimes dip below zero.",

Youll find historic alpine huts dotted throughout the area,  including nearby Botherum Plain Hut, and Daveys Hut which was built in 1909. To get there, cross the river at the bridge and follow the walking track heading northwest for 2km. Napthalis Homestead site is 1.5km further along the plain.If youre lucky, youll have this remote campground all to yourself, aside from the local wildlife. Red-necked wallabies and eastern grey kangaroos can often be seen bounding across the plains. At dusk, keep an eye out for wombats and ring-tailed possums that come down to the river to drink.In spring and summer, the frost hollow grasslands are covered in yellow native daisies. At 1300m in elevation, temperatures can fall well below zero in winter, so its best to visit during the warmer months.",

The campground has caravan and camper trailer sites, as well as scenic tent sites.A great place for a weekend getaway, theres easy access to some of the attractions in Barrington Tops National Park, including the easy Polblue Swamp walking track, a short one that the children will love.If you do walk the Polblue Swamp track, youre likely to see a kangaroo or wombat hanging out along the track. The best time to see them is early in the morning as they graze for some brekkie in the forest. Four-wheelers should also try the nearby Barrington trail.",

Your best chance to view these majestic falls in all their beauty is spring through autumn, when the weather is warmer and the river flowing after local rainfall.If the sight of all this water makes you keen for a cool, refreshing dip, head past Upper Falls picnic area and walk 250m along a scenic walking track to a magical spot upstream of the main falls. This is Upper Falls, where water cascades over small rocky cliffs into a delightful swimming hole. If youve worked up an appetite, head back to the campground to cook up a tasty evening meal on one of the barbecues. As you and your crew relax and tuck in, keep an eye out for the flash of colourful birds like turquoise parrots and flame robins in the bush around you. Hunker down for a peaceful night under the stars, the silence broken only by the rustle and squeak of squirrel gliders and other night-time creatures.",

Apart from the resident wildlife in the park, you might get lucky and have the place to yourself.This campground is not for everyone, as it can only be accessed on foot and the hut itself is fairly rustic. However because of this, it's a tranquil place to reflect, relax and admire the view of the Breadknife and Grand High Tops and the stars.

Take a walk in the forest, cast your fishing line into the river or just lie back and listen to the chorus of birds in the trees above.As dusk sets in, keep your eyes out for swamp wallabies and ring-tailed and brush-tailed possums around the campsite. Then get ready for a peaceful night around the campfire and a bit of stargazing.",

Paddling the magnificent Nymboida River is a great way to explore the rainforest-lined riverbanks and rugged granite cliffs of Nymboi-Binderay National Park.Pop up your tent near the scenic river beside the towering forests of wet eucalypt and lush rainforest. Some of the crystal clear waters of this mountain river are ideal for swimming and fishing.The surrounding dense forests and riverbanks hum with wildlife and provide habitat for a wide range of rare and threatened frogs. As the light fades, listen for the distinct call of the stuttering frog and the cry of the catbird. Kick back around the campfire and tune in to the symphony of the bush.",

You can also explore the ruins of the Old Fort Grey homestead or explore the area by bicycle.Cameron Corner, where the borders of NSW, Queensland and South Australia meet and the Dingo Fence extends as far as you can see is a good daytrip from Fort Grey. Theres a store so you can refresh supplies and fuel if need be. The campground is also close to one end of Middle Road if you feel like a day of 4WD touring.As you cook up your dinner on the barbecue, look out for red and western grey kangaroos dusk-grazing around the campground.

Not to be outdone, cheeky little finches hop through the scrub.After a day exploring, cool off with a swim in the river before preparing a barbecue feast.

        "description": "When the modern world gets too much, you know its time to load up the campervan and head for the hills. Apsley Falls campground, on the western edge of Oxley Wild Rivers National Park, is your ticket to serenity. This unique bush site, in northern NSW, is a world away from the city crowds. Its the perfect bush stop on a driving holiday and a great base for walking and birdwatching.Pitch your tent among a forest of stringybarks and white gums. As you settle in for your stay, keep an eye out for grey kangaroos and wallabies that often drop by for a visit. Make sure you bring your binoculars to spot some of the abundant birdlife in the area including crimson rosellas, red wattlebirds and thornbills.Once youve set up camp, its time to explore the park. Take nearby Apsley Gorge Rim walking track, a short loop walk packed with scenic views of the rugged Apsley Gorge and main falls. If youve still got energy to burn, venture onto Oxley walking track, which traces the northern rim of the Apsley Gorge for spectacular views of both the main and lower falls.After a day of exploring, head back to the campsite for a barbecue feast. If youre keen to see some wildlife after the sun sets, grab a torch; you may be lucky enough to see a platypus at dusk, or the elusive spotted-tailed quoll after night falls.",

        "description": "Who would have thought you could be so close to the city and yet so far from civilisation? \n\nUloola Falls campground in Royal National Park is a great nature getaway, especially if you're looking for things to do near Sydney.For a relaxing start to your weekend escape, catch the train. \n\nDont forget your hiking boots because this campground is reached via the long Uloola walking track or the medium difficulty Karloo walking track. If youre particularly adventurous, you can cycle there on your mountain bike from Waterfall.\n\nPassing through heathlands, you'll be bathed in colour by the wildflower displays in spring. Keep an eye out for the gymea lily with its single stem and vibrant red flower.Once you arrive, set up camp beside picturesque Uloola Falls and sleep under the stars. \n\nYour only distraction here will be the splash of the waterfall as it hits the rock pool below.Take a virtual tour of Uloola Falls campground captured with Google Street View Trekker.",

At dusk, relax by the campfire as wallabies, kangaroos and emus come down to the river to drink.If youre looking for a bit of adventure, go 4WDing or mountain biking along Forest Drive. This scenic 16km journey is a great way to explore the park and there are plenty of spots to fish, swim and enjoy a picnic along the way. At the end of the drive youll find Turkey Flat trail which is a cycling trail that loops through the habitats of native woodland and wetland birds.",

It is the last lighthouse of the James Barnet style to be built, and the last staffed lighthouse constructed in New South Wales.\n\nThe lighthouse was built between 1901 and 1903, and was designed by Charles Assinder Harding. It is a 28-metre-tall (92 ft) tower made of sandstone and brick. The lighthouse's light is visible for 22 nautical miles (41 km).\n\nNorah Head Lighthouse is an important navigation aid for ships travelling between Sydney and Newcastle. It is also a popular tourist destination, and visitors can climb the tower to enjoy stunning views of the coastline. The lighthouse is also home to a small museum that tells the story of the lighthouse and its keepers.\n\nThe lighthouse is located in a scenic reserve, and there are a number of walking trails that wind their way through the bush to the lighthouse. The reserve is also home to a variety of wildlife, including wallabies, kangaroos, and kookaburras.",

As waves rush into a submerged sea cave, water is forced upward through a narrow opening, creating a dramatic plume of seawater that can soar several metres into the air. \n\nThe blowhole is a mesmerizing sight, especially during high tide or when the sea is turbulent. Visitors can enjoy the view from nearby lookouts and explore the surrounding scenic coastline, making it a memorable experience for all.",

        "description": "The 9 signs on this trail are an initiative of the Far South Coast Branch of the National Trust, Merrimans Local Aboriginal Land Council and Bermagui Primary School. They recognise the sacred places, legends, history and recent achievements of the Djiringanj Clan of the Yuin Nation who have been the custodians of this country for 40,000 to 50,000 years. The trail is 15 kilometres long; the location of the signs is marked with an orange Y on the Bermagui town map/services guide.\n\nDickinson Point Headland\n\nStarting from the Bermagui Visitor Information Centre, turn right out of the car park onto Bunga Street and at the T-intersection turn right again onto Lamont Street. Follow the road for about 300 metres, turn right into Pacific Drive and then left onto the gravel road on Dickinson Point. The sign is on the northern side of the headland looking towards Gulaga Mountain.\n\nBilima Rock\n\nReturn to Pacific Drive, turn left and continue for approximately 250 metres to the picnic table on the left. Bilima Rock is a huge ochre coloured rock formation shaped like a sea turtle with its flippers in the sea, at the base of the cliff.\n\nBermagui Sacred Waterhole\n\nTurn back along Pacific Drive and turn left into Lamont Street. Follow the road for approximately 1.5 kilometres, taking the last left turn before the Bermagui River Bridge. Then turn left into West Street and left again into Hill Street. The sign is on the cul-de-sac at the end of the street overlooking the sacred waterhole.\n\nKoori Trading Routes\n\nReturn to and cross the Bermagui River Bridge, head north for 6 kilometres on Wallaga Lake Road to Fairhaven Point Way. The sign is on the left at the corner of the turn off to Fairhaven Point Way.\n\nFairhaven Point Midden\n\nContinue down Fairhaven Point Way for 1.5 kilometres and the sign is on the left when you reach the end of the sealed road, about 180 metres before the cul-de-sac at the end of the road.\n\nMurunna\n\nReturn to the T-intersection at Wallaga Lake Road and turn left. Travel north for 1.2 kilometres and take the right turn to Camel Rock Surf Beach. The sign for Murunna is located in the car park at the end of the road, beside the path to Murunna headland.\n\nGulaga, the Mother Mountain\n\nReturn to the T-intersection at Wallaga Lake Road and turn right. Travel 800 metres and turn right into Lake View Drive at Wallaga Lake Heights. From the car park at the end of this road walk east along the lake's edge on the track to Murunna Point. The sign is 200 metres along this track at the small pavilion with carved posts.\n\n### Yuin Umbarra, Djiringanj Lands, Wallaga Lake & Merriman Island\n\nReturn to Wallaga Lake Road, turn right and continue for 1.5 kilometres to the rest area on the right immediately before Wallaga Lake Bridge. The sign is in the car park area near the amenities block.\n\n### Najenuga\n\nFrom the rest area turn right and cross the Wallaga Lake single lane bridge. Continue on this road, Bermagui Road, for 2.6 kilometres. The last trail sign is on your left about 750 metres past Youngs Road.\n\n_Sincere thanks also to Wallaga Lake-Bermagui Men's Shed for helping to install the signs, Mumbulla Foundation for partially funding this project and Bega Valley Shire Council for their support and encouragement._",

The steep trail meanders down the sandstone cliff in a series of zigzags. Along the way, you'll find short detours leading to the charming Victoria Creek Cascades and the summit of Victoria Falls, while the primary trail continues its descent to the base of the waterfall.\n\nConsider bringing along a picnic lunch to savor amidst the stunning waterfall surroundings, where the waters tumble approximately 20 meters over a rocky overhang. In the summertime, this location offers a tranquil oasis, ideal for relaxation in the shade of the luxuriant canopy.\n\nThe arduous journey back up to the carpark typically requires approximately 60 to 90 minutes.",

Captain James Cook named the headland Point Danger on his voyage to Australia in 1770. \n\nToday, Point Danger Lookout is a safe and popular place to visit. Visitors can enjoy the views from the lookout platform, or take a walk along the Centaur Remembrance Walk, which commemorates the loss of the Australian Hospital Ship Centaur in 1943. \n\nThe lookout is also home to a number of other attractions, including the Captain Cook Memorial, the Point Danger Lighthouse, and the Point Danger Cafe.",

Begin your journey by taking the gravel path that meanders between the cafe and car park in Tilba Tilba, embarking on an unforgettable adventure. \n\nAs you make your way, pause at 'Halfway Rock,' where the Battery Trail diverges from the main path, leading you 1.6 kilometres along the ridge to the remnants of the mine manager's dwelling. After exploring this historical site, rejoin the main trail, and approximately 30 minutes later, you'll arrive at 'The Saddle.' This tranquil resting spot unveils the splendor of enormous granite tors concealed within the rainforest. From here, muster your strength for the final ascent to the summit, which offers breathtaking panoramic views of the coastal landscape. \n\nThis scenic hike spans 14 kilometres round-trip and is estimated to take around five hours to complete. It is rated as a challenging trek, commencing near the cafe in Tilba Tilba.",

The falls are a popular spot for hiking and swimming, and the surrounding rainforest is home to a variety of native plants and animals.\n\nThere are two walking trails at Killen Falls:\n\nThe Killen Falls Viewing Platform Walk is a short, 660-metre return walk that takes you to a viewpoint overlooking the falls. This is a good option for families and people with limited mobility. The Killen Falls Base Walk is a 1-kilometre return walk that takes you to the base of the falls. This walk is a bit more challenging, as it involves some steep sections. The best time to visit Killen Falls is during the wet season (October to April), when the falls are flowing at their fullest. However, the falls are also beautiful during the dry season (May to September).",

        "description": "Moonbi Lookout and Park is a spacious area perched on top of a hill, offering panoramic views of the Cockburn Valley and the surrounding countryside. The park is a popular destination for campers, picnickers, and nature lovers, providing a peaceful retreat from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.\n\nThe lookout is the main attraction of the park, featuring a flat gravel site with ample space for vehicles and camping gear. The views from the lookout are simply breathtaking, encompassing rolling hills, lush greenery, and meandering rivers. On a clear day, one can even spot the distant peaks of the New England Range.\n\nThe park also features two sheltered picnic tables, perfect for enjoying a leisurely meal or simply relaxing and soaking in the scenery. For those who wish to cook outdoors, there are also barbecue pits available, along with rubbish bins for proper disposal of waste. However, it is important to note that there is no water source in the park, so visitors are advised to bring their own drinking water and supplies.\n\nWhile the park is generally accessible, the toilets are located below the lookout, making them challenging for wheelchair users to access. It is hoped that the authorities will consider making the toilets more accessible in the future to ensure that everyone can enjoy the park's amenities.",

        "description": "This family-friendly walk treats you to ever-changing views of the grand Three Sisters, rising nearly a kilometre above sea level.\n\nPass through the archway, next to the Echo Point Visitor Centre, and you'll soon be surrounded by soaring eucalypt forest, bird calls and fresh mountain air. Keep an eye out for the superb lyrebird and crimson rosellas as you walk the gently sloping path for 400m to Oreades lookout. Marvel at the incredible views of the Three Sisters' weather-eroded sandstone turrets, and the hazy 'blue' Jamison Valley stretching to Mount Solitary.\n\nFrom here, steps lead a further 50m to Lady Game lookout, for a closer view of this remarkable rock formation. A short but very steep set of stairs at the top of the Giant Stairway leads to Honeymoon Bridge, which connects to the first sister.\n\nOn the way back, enjoy the short signposted detour to Spooners lookout.",

They are possibly the most photographed rocks along the Eurobodalla coastline.\n\nAt the northern end of the beach there is a display of igneous pillow lava which formed through the lava flow of a submarine volcano.\n\nHow to get there: At low tide you can walk to the rocks from Surf Beach carpark, around the headland to Glasshouse Rocks. Here you will see more of the rocks, which are impressive in stature. The pillow lava display is easily accessed along the beach, approximately 300m north of the carpark.\n\nFor headland views, follow Glasshouse Rocks Road and veer left onto Cemetery Road and the Narooma Cemetery carpark. Head past the cemetery on foot towards the white fence.\n\nTo access the beach, you can walk around the fence into bush to access a track (no signs). At the fork in the trail veer left down a fairly steep dirt track. At the beach head south to reach Glasshouse Rocks.\n\nExercise caution! The track is not suitable for the mobility impaired, elderly or young children and is not signposted.",

It was built in 1860 and decommissioned in 1899. The lighthouse was constructed of sandstone blocks quarried near the present-day Jervis Bay village. It was a three-story building with eight rooms at ground level. The tower was 61 feet (18.5 meters) high. \n\nThe lighthouse was built to mark the southern entrance to Jervis Bay. It was an important navigational aid for ships sailing between Sydney and Melbourne. However, the lighthouse was located on a high cliff, and it was often obscured by fog. This led to a number of shipwrecks in the area. \n\nThe lighthouse was decommissioned in 1899 and replaced by the Point Perpendicular Lighthouse. The Cape St George Lighthouse was demolished in the early 1920s. However, the ruins of the lighthouse still remain today.",

        "description": "Head to Purtle Park Adventure Playground on the banks of Lake Mulwala for an outing the whole family can enjoy. This family-friendly park contains a free-standing all-abilities play system with attractive modern designs, overlooking the water. \n\nThe park encourages risk-taking and problem solving for older children, with sky cabins and swaying walkways 5 metres above the ground. Officially opened in December 2020, a toddler play area, fenced play area, water and vertical play areas, a basket swing, the pelican nest and a flying fox are among the many fun attractions to be found at the park. \n\nPack a picnic, make use of the undercover barbecue facilities, or make the short walk to one of the delicious bakeries or cafes found North of the Murray. This is where there's more to life.",
