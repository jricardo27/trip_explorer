Some free refreshments including cold water provided. \n\nMultiple Golden Guitar winner Tom Curtain's Katherine Outback Experience show offers a unique insight into life on Australian outback cattle stations, highlighting the important role of working dogs and horses in the pastoral industry.\n\nCome and watch the team start a young untrained horse, work the cattle dogs and sing a few Aussie anthems, often from the saddle. Children are invited to interact with the station animals - some of which are unique to the outback. The show is in a constant state of evolution, with new animals and acts being introduced on a weekly basis. No two shows are the same.\n\nAn experience not to be missed that will leave you with a greater understanding and appreciation of the everyday men and women who live and work in the outback.",

Birds will move in from the surrounding countryside and can easily be observed by sitting quietly by the edge of the waterhole.\n\nThe site of the Carpet Snake Dreaming, some areas in the Gorge and western cliffs have special significance to the Western Arrernte custodians.\n\nSerpentine Gorge is also the Trailhead for sections 7 and 8 of the Larapinta Trail, a 231-kilometre long distance walking trail through the West MacDonnell Ranges.\n\nAccess is by conventional two-wheel drive vehicles but can be difficult to negotiate in wet weather, as the last few kilometres is rough access track.

Gadalathami is a three kilometre stretch of white sand and makes for a pleasant afternoon walk to watch the sunset. You can access the beach via the Gove Peninsula Surf Lifesaving Club carpark or there is a beach access walkway located between the Gove Aquatic Centre and the Walkabout Lodge and Tavern in Nhulunbuy.\n\nGadalathami is the site of the Gove Peninsula Surf Lifesaving Club, which was established in 1974 and you can often see them patrolling the beach on the weekends between the months of May and October. On Friday nights at the 'Surfy' you can purchase drinks from their licensed bar or enjoy a delicious burger from local volunteer clubs who take it in turns to cook up a storm on the outdoor kitchen. The clubhouse is located on grassy bluffs at the very southern end of the beach, where it offers spectacular views of the coastline.\n\n",

Located only a short half hour drive, approximately 30km, from Nhulunbuy you turn right off Dhupuma Road onto a smaller dirt track that takes you to the various recreational areas.\n\nThe Wathawuy stream is shallow in most spots with a sandy bottom, however, there are some deeper waterholes that are mostly located at the Goanna Lagoon side. This hidden oasis has small cascading rapids that trickle downstream and shady riverbanks lined with an abundance of native flora such as pandanus. There is easy access to the water at several spots, making Wathawuy a popular destination when visiting the region.\n\nCrystal clear water runs here all year round but during the monsoonal season Dhimurru Aboriginal Corporation will sometimes close the area to limit environmental damage to the track and recreational areas due to excess rain and vehicle traffic.\n\nThere are several day trip and overnight camping areas located at both the Latram River and Goanna Lagoon with picnic tables and fire pits available. There is one composting toilet facility available at both Goanna Lagoon and Latram River.\n\n- A Visitor Access Permit from Dhimurru Aboriginal Corporation is required to visit this area\n- A Camping Permit from Dhimurru Aboriginal Corporation is required if camping overnight\n- 4WD vehicle is required\n- Potable water is not available at this location\n- There is unreliable phone reception at this location\n- Wildlife is known to frequent this location",

Once you have turned off the main road the track in to the recreational area is a well maintained dirt road with a small creek crossing.\n\nBanambarrna is a sheer section of coastline where the exposed and weathered rock profile produces a striking colourful effect on the cliff face as it plunges over 40 meters into the sea, giving it the nick name Rainbow Cliff. Open forest runs to the top of the cliff and a small tidal creek winds through a mangrove community to spill into the sea at its western end, where there is easy access to a sandy beach. The top of the cliff is a Sacred Site and access is not permitted.\n\nFollow the road to the eastern side of the cliffs to see a spectacular view from the laterite shelf adjacent to the cliff base. The western side of the track leads to a small cliff that looks out over the ocean and provides access to the beach. It is here you will find campsites boasting a spectacular view with picnic tables and a composting toilet.\n\n- A Visitor Access Permit from Dhimurru Aboriginal Corporation is required to visit this area\n- A Camping Permit from Dhimurru Aboriginal Corporation is required if camping overnight\n- 4WD vehicle is required\n- Potable water is not available at this location\n- There is unreliable phone reception at this location\n- Wildlife is known to frequent this location",

These paths remain accessible throughout the year, yet their true splendor is unveiled during the wet season when the tropical summer rains replenish the creeks, plunge pools, and waterfalls. \n\nIf the allure of monsoon rainforest-lined trails, secluded swimming oases, and the opportunity to encounter woodland wildlife captivates your senses, delve deeper to uncover the hidden treasures of Yurmikmik Walks - perhaps one of Kakadu's best-kept secrets. \n\nThey are undoubtedly an integral part of any Kakadu wet season adventure!",

The trail winds its way through the Nitmiluk Gorge, which is home to towering cliffs, lush rainforests, and ancient Aboriginal rock art.\n\nOne of the highlights of the Jatbula Trail is the Crystal Falls area. This section of the trail is particularly scenic, with a series of rock pools, rapids, and small cascades that lead up to the main waterfall. The waterfall itself is impressive, with a powerful torrent of water cascading over a cliff edge into a crystal-clear pool below.\n\nIf you're planning on hiking the Jatbula Trail, be sure to pack plenty of water and food, as there are no facilities along the trail. The trail is also best hiked during the dry season (May to September) when the weather is cooler and there is less risk of mosquitoes.",

Along the walk you will see the unique stone arrangements constructed over 100 years ago by the Yolngu elders to educate future generations about the history of the Macassan traders who visited the region from Indonesia in the early 1700s. \n\nThis fascinating walk gives an insight into the trade between the Yolngu and the Macassans that existed for several centuries when the Macassans would fish for the native trepang (a type of sea cucumber) from the North Australian waters. Trepang was considered a delicacy in their culture at the time. \n\nTravellers must obtain a recreation permit from Dhimurru Aboriginal Corporation prior to visiting the area and there are a number of accommodation options in the nearby town of Nhulunbuy.",

It was one of 15 stations built along the Overland Telegraph Line, which connected Adelaide to Darwin in 1872. The station was built in 1871 by a team led by John Ross. It was originally constructed of stone and mud, but was later rebuilt in brick. The station consisted of a number of buildings, including a telegraph office, a post office, a store, and quarters for the station staff. \n\nThe Barrow Creek Telegraph Station was an important communication link between Adelaide and Darwin for many years. It played a vital role in the development of the Northern Territory, and was also used by the Australian government to communicate with its troops during World War I and World War II. \n\nThe station was closed in 1971, but was later restored and reopened as a museum in 1980. Today, visitors to the Barrow Creek Telegraph Station can learn about the history of the station and its role in the development of Australia.",

The Tennant Creek Telegraph Station was an important communication link between Adelaide and Darwin for many years. \n\nIt played a vital role in the development of the Northern Territory, and was also used by the Australian government to communicate with its troops during World War I and World War II. \n\nThe station was closed in 1935, but was later restored and reopened as a museum in 1980. Today, visitors to the Tennant Creek Telegraph Station can learn about the history of the station and its role in the development of Australia.",

        "description": "Jones Store is one of the oldest surviving structures in Newcastle Waters, a former stock route junction town in the Barkly region of the Northern Territory, Australia. Built in the mid-1930s, the store was constructed of corrugated iron, bamboo, and earth. It served as a vital hub for the drovers who moved cattle over the Murranji, Barkly, and north-south stock routes, providing them with provisions and other essential supplies.\n\nIn addition to selling provisions, Jones Store also provided a number of other vital services, including a butcher, baker, and saddler. It was also a social gathering place for the drovers, who would often come to the store to relax and unwind after a long day on the trail.\n\nAfter the stock routes ceased to be used in the 1970s, Jones Store fell into disrepair. However, in the 1990s, the store was restored and converted into a museum. Today, Jones Store is a popular tourist destination, offering visitors a glimpse into the life of outback drovers in the early 20th century.",

With 16 designated sites available, the campground provides a modest yet comfortable setting for your outdoor retreat.\n\nSituated amidst the Davenport and Murchison Ranges within the Barkly Tablelands, this park holds distinction as one of the earliest established national parks in the region. Serving as a vital sanctuary for wildlife, particularly waterfowl, thanks to its expansive network of waterholes.\n\nACCESS TO THE SITE:\nLocated southeast of Tennant Creek, accessing the park can be achieved via two primary routes:\nOne option is to veer off the Stuart Highway at Bonney Well, following the Kurundi/Epenarra road. Alternatively, you can opt for the Stuart Highway exit at Taylor Creek, leading onto the Murray Downs/Hatches Creek road. While this latter route may be a bit slower, its scenic charm makes the journey well worth it.",

The crocodiles are particularly active at high tide, when they come to the crossing to feed on fish and other animals that are washed over the road.\n\nSafety: Aside from ensuring you have enough water and fuel and your permits are in order, you should also Be Crocwise. There are crocodiles all over Arnhem Land, even if you\u2019re not near the coast, so don\u2019t just follow the signs \u2013 make sure you\u2019ve double and triple checked before going swimming, fishing or boating. Cahill\u2019s Crossing has a high number of crocodiles, so be extra careful and be sure to cross at low tide. Drop in to the Bowali Visitor Centre or the Border Store to ask if it\u2019s safe to cross, and ensure you don\u2019t enter the water here.",

Traditional owners ask that the karlu (marbles) are not climbed.\n\nIn a historic ceremony held here on 27 October 2008, ownership of the Karlu Karlu / Devils Marbles Conservation Reserve was officially given back to the site's traditional owners.\n\nThe reserve is now jointly managed with the traditional owners and Parks and Wildlife rangers. The rocks are a cooler, sheltered environment for plants and animals.\n\nKeep an eye out for small black-headed goannas in boulder crevices.\n\nYou may also see zebra finch and painted finch throughout the reserve. Fairy martins create bottle-shaped mud nests on the underside of overhanging boulders.\n\nThis park requires visitors to the NT to have a parks pass.",

It includes steep and rocky sections, so it's important to exercise caution and take your time as you navigate it. \n\nIf you choose to complete the entire Valley of the Winds circuit, it typically takes about 3 to 4 hours to finish. You'll find a water source roughly midway through the trail, which can be a welcome refreshment. \n\nAlternatively, for a shorter and less strenuous option, you can opt to walk to one of the lookouts and then return. Interestingly, the full circuit is often considered easier than walking to the second lookout, known as Karingana, and coming back. ",

Visit Ormiston Gorge, Redbank Gorge, or Ellery Creek Big Hole for a swim in refreshing waters surrounded by dramatic ochre bluffs.
