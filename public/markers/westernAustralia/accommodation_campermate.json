No need to worry about any logistics as Dwellingup Adventures do all the organizing for you! Meet at the Tours Desk, located at the award-winning Dwellingup Trails and Visitors Centre with the lovely Waypoints Cafe. \n\nFrom here you will get fitted out with your safety equipment and head to the start of the rafting experience, following a guide in your own vehicle. Leave your vehicle at the finish point and let Dwellingup Adventures transport you to the start, stopping along the way to point out river features. \n\nYou spend the next few hours shooting some small rapids, paddling through fast-moving channels and along wide pools at your own pace. The lightness of your inflated raft allows you to easily carry your raft back above some of the rapids where you can shoot them multiple times before paddling to the finish point at Dwaarlindjirraap, where you rendezvous with Dwellingup Adventures and your car.\n\n- Operates daily.\n- Starts: 10.30am. Finishes: 3.00pm\n- Self-guided\n- Ages 6+ recommended",

The Skipper will entertain and inform with commentary on the natural history and development of Lake Argyle, The Ord River Irrigation System and the Aquaculture Industry. You'll encounter Rock Wallabies, Crocodiles, Wallaroos (Euros) and the diverse array of birdlife that call Lake Argyle home. \n\nYou'll be delighted and awed by the Archer Fish that shoot water up at your hand with amazing precision.

As the sun sinks behind the glorious Carr Boyd Ranges, you'll enjoy a complimentary drink and a light snack to make the most of this magic time of day.

If you are sensitive to the cold, bring a light jacket to wear while we are motoring.

However be aware that these beaches are notoriously treacherous for vehicles and it is easy to become bogged in the most innocent looking wet or dry sand. Ask the ranger about surface conditions and tides.\n\nGetting there\nDunn Rocks is a 45 minute drive east of Esperance, mostly by sealed road. The last 14km south along Dunn Rock Rd is unsealed, suitable for four-wheel-drive only.\n ",

These microorganisms produce carotenoids, which are pigments that give the lake its pink hue.\n\nLake Hillier is about 600 meters long and 250 meters wide. It is surrounded by a rim of sand and a dense woodland of paperbark and eucalyptus trees. The lake is located in a remote area of Middle Island, and the only way to see it is by boat or plane.",

The town is also home to a number of Aboriginal communities, who have lived in the area for thousands of years.\n\nOne of the most popular attractions in Beagle Bay is the Beagle Bay Cemetery, which is the final resting place of over 1,000 Japanese pearl divers who died in the region between 1912 and 1942. The cemetery is a moving reminder of the sacrifices made by these men, and it is a popular spot for visitors to pay their respects.\n\nAnother popular attraction in Beagle Bay is the Beagle Bay Rock Art. This ancient rock art is located on a cliff face overlooking the ocean, and it is believed to be over 10,000 years old. The rock art depicts a variety of animals and people, and it provides a fascinating glimpse into the lives of the Aboriginal people who lived in the area thousands of years ago.\n",

The Pinnacles were formed over 25,000 to 30,000 years ago, when the sea receded and left behind deposits of sea shells. Over time, these deposits hardened and were eroded by the wind and rain, forming the pinnacles that we see today.\n\nThe Pinnacles Desert is a popular tourist destination, and visitors can explore the area on foot, by bike, or by car. There are a number of walking trails that wind through the pinnacles, and visitors can also climb to the top of some of the tallest pinnacles for stunning views of the surrounding area.",

The salt mine produces the purest grade of salt in the world, which is used in a variety of applications, including food production, water treatment, and pharmaceuticals.\n\nWhile Useless Loop is not open to the public, visitors to Denham can still get a glimpse of the salt mine from a distance. The salt mine can be seen from the beach at Denham, where it appears as a white mountain in the distance. For those with a four-wheel drive vehicle, there is a track that leads to a viewpoint where the salt mine can be seen up close.\n\nThe Useless Loop salt mine is a reminder of the unique natural resources that Australia has to offer. It is also a testament to the ingenuity of the people who have developed ways to extract and use these resources in a sustainable way.",

Visitors can explore the maze-like tunnels and chambers, marvel at the rock textures and colors, and take in the fascinating geological features. \n\nStockyard Gully Caves are also famous for their historical significance, as they were once used as shelter by early settlers and gold prospectors in the area. Exploring the caves provides a glimpse into the region's pioneering past. \n\nIt's important to note that while the caves are open to the public, visitors should exercise caution and be well-prepared with suitable footwear and lighting when exploring them.",

The trail begins at the campground, where visitors must first cross Manning Creek to re-join the trail path on the other side. Visitors may swim the 100 metres across, or use the rope guide with floats to ferry belongings. \n\nThe trail follows a route overland rather than along the creek with views over the ranges and savannah woodlands along the way. The terrain is uneven, with some rock scrambling and an incline towards the end. The trail is mostly unshaded, so it is important to bring drinking water and to wear a hat. ",

        "description": "One of the most spectacular sites at DEntrecasteaux is Black Point, a massive outcrop of hexagonal basalt columns formed 135 million years ago by volcanic lava flow.\n\nBlack Point owes its unique appearance to the lava which flowed from the Darling Scarp and slowly cooled at the ocean. In the cooling process the lava cracked and shrunk, and close packed, hexagonal columns were formed perpendicular to the surface. These Stepping Stones  as they are known as are now slowly being eroded away by the Southern Ocean. To reach the black basalt columns that give Black Point its name, a short walk is required along the beach. In calm weather, you may be able to get close enough to the basalt pillars to hear the organ-like music they create as the waves and wind echo through their gaps.\n\nBlack Point is approximately 2 hours from Augusta and access is by 4WD only. Be sure to reduce your tyre pressure to suit the conditions once you reach the sandy section. Black Point Road is closed in winter due to the tracks becoming inundated.\n\nThere are 20 camp sites at Humpback Hollow and 10 at Seal Cove with basic facilities. Popular with fishers, surfers and sightseers, the sites operate on a first come, first serve basis. Camping fees apply.\n\nBlack Point long been known to local surfers, who have been coming here for years and helped popularise the site. Fishing from the rocks is also popular but it can be dangerous. \n\nNo dogs ",

The climb is challenging but rewarding, and the views from the top are simply stunning.\n\nDiamond Tree Lookout Manjimup provides a unique opportunity to gain a spectacular birds eye view across the treetops of the Karri forest near Manjimup.

The walk starts at the Longing, Memory, Sight artwork, which is a fragment of a letter sent by a soldier to his loved one. The walk then takes you through a series of 21 interpretive markers, each of which tells the story of a different ship in the first and second convoys. The lookout at the end of the walk offers stunning views of King George Sound, where the troops gathered on ships before departing for war. There is also a shelter at the lookout with interpretive material about the convoys. The walk is suitable for all ages and fitness levels. It is approximately 1.5 kilometres long and takes around 30 minutes to complete. The lookout is accessible by wheelchair.",

There is also a coin operated laundry and plenty of clothes lines. The general camping area is large, flat and spacious and the Bar and the Restaurant are just a short stroll away.\n\nPayment for camping can be made at the station shop, 8am to 5pm, daily.\nFor late arrivals ( preferably not)  please pay at the Bar / Reception, between 5pm and 7.30pm.\n\nCheck in and registration is essential for all camping, prior to setting up any camp.\n\nDuring the winter it gets dark quite early here, in mid dry season June / July, by 5.30pm. It is highly recommended that you be off these unfenced roads before dark\n\nNOTE: MINERS POOL, on the Drysdale River - NO toilets, NO camping. Please request to visit for no charge day use ONLY\n ",

The ancient gorge has deep blue water, red limestone cliff faces and a wonderful array of birds and wildlife including the rare black-footed wallaby and red kangaroos. From the top, the views into the creek and out to the Ningaloo Reed are purely spectacular.\n\nThe 1.5 kilometre walk trail slowly climbs up the red rock cliffs over a flat path which then becomes harder as it narrows and requires navigation of rocks and small creek line gullies. The trail follows the gorge, becoming more difficult as you ascend the range, however, the views into the gorge are well worth the effort. From the top of the gorge walls, look out for the wide variety of birds and yellow-footed rock wallabies that inhabit the rock walls.\n\nAll activities start at the Yardie Creek car park where there are toilets and picnic areas.\n\nYardie Creek Gorge, located in Cape Range National Park, Western Australia, is a stunning geological formation characterized by sheer red limestone cliffs that rise majestically along the tranquil waterway. Visitors can enjoy scenic boat tours within the gorge, spot diverse birdlife, and explore hiking trails offering panoramic vistas. The gorge is also home to rock wallabies and provides picnicking facilities. Yardie Creek Gorge is a captivating destination within Cape Range National Park, offering a unique blend of natural beauty and outdoor experiences.",

Bush Bay is an extremely popular fishing beach, and a great spot to launch a tinnie. \n\nThere are heaps of spots to get your boat close to the water at Bush Bay, though pick your location carefully, as the beaches are soft, launching at a high tide is much easier too. You can catch Whiting and Flat Heads just off the beach, though if you launch a tinnie, you have the opportunity to catch some larger fish and do some squidding. ",

Replacing the original stone lighthouse, it stands impressively at 38 meters, ranking as Australia's fourth tallest lighthouse of its kind. This advanced structure introduced cutting-edge technology to the island, boasting a holophotal revolving light flashing every 20 seconds, greatly improving navigation for passing ships and reducing coral shore groundings. Initially powered by electricity in 1936, it achieved full automation in 1990. Today, with its powerful, far-reaching light spanning 26 nautical miles, the Wadjemup Lighthouse remains a vital guide for safe navigation towards Fremantle port.",

The Milky Way arcs overhead, and there's no sign of human presence.\n\nWhile remote, Lake Brown is a popular camping spot, especially along its western shore. A rocky granite ridge with caves, boulders, and bush offers an excellent vantage point of the lake and surrounding fields.

It was part of the Kerguelen large igneous province that formed over a period from about 130 to 95 million years ago as Australia, India and Antarctica split apart.\n\nLess than a kilometre from Bunbury\u2019s central business district, the area has a beach lookout, interpretive information, barbecues, playground and picnic facilities.\n\nThere is a wide, level path surrounding the picnic area which connects the parking with the beach lookout, accessible toilets and change room.\n\nA free fully self-contained vehicle 48-hour camping location is also here.

Only Chappells Rd remains passable. Some visitors have removed posts to gain access beyond the approved routes, but management may restrict or close access in the future. In the past, steel stakes were placed inside bollards to prevent this.\n\nThere is a single bay near one table and fireplace, and a day-use area near the old bridge site with a table and fireplace. A car pull-off bay is also nearby. The old riding hut, which once had a table and fireplace, has since been destroyed. The site also includes a double car bay.\n\nPlease note: Tiger snakes are common in the area. For a longer stay, Greens Island is a more suitable option for overnight or extended visits.",

Snorkel in the shallows. Take breaks beneath nearby shade trees. As the furthest point of land on the southwest coast, exploration forms an enormous part of Augusta\u2019s character and history.\n",

For example, near Hut Pool, just to the east, where the Great North Road crosses the river. If you have a 4WD you can explore the many bush tracks shown on the map.\n\nThe Blackwood River here has several large pools suitable for swimming, canoeing, fishing for bream and marron in season. There are many vehicle and walking tracks, some courtesy of marron hunters, that are pleasant for hiking.\n\n",

Tucked away from the wind, with rock faces on either side, this is the perfect spot for swimming and sun baking on a sunny Esperance day. Depending on the tides, there can be limited beaches available to set up for the day, but the rocks are a perfect spot to lay on and soak up the sun.\n\nWhilst taking a refreshing dip out in the bay, don\u2019t forget to turn around and admire the rugged coastline. The rock faces and cliffs contrast beautifully against the blue water and white sand, reminding you of just how incredible these hidden beaches are.\n\nBlue Haven is one of the many beaches along the Great Ocean Drive, which twists and turns alongside the coastline offering fantastic views and building anticipation for that very first dip in Esperance\u2019s beaches.",

The tunnel is up to 20m high and 15m wide in some parts! 350 million years ago this was part of an ocean reef system.  \n\nThere is a Kimberley feel all-around. Sunlight arcs onto the cathedral-like cavern with a sense of mystery. Adding to the spectacle, large stalactite rock formations hang from the walls.  \n\nA deep history, as well as beauty exists here. It was used as a hideout late last century by the Aboriginal leader Jandamarra who was killed outside its entrance in 1897. \n\nTake a walk through the 750m tunnel which takes you from one side of the Napier Range to the other. Keep your eye out for the many bat species and freshwater crocodiles that live in the cave. The roof has collapsed through to the top of the range near the centre of the tunnel. Take a torch, wear sneakers and be prepared to get wet and possibly cold and always let someone know where you are. \n\nYou\u2019ll never forget a walk into the tunnel of surprises. It's Crocodile Dundee and Indiana Jones all in one spot!",

A myriad of fish, including over 70 species of finfish, and coral can be seen swimmingl through the tranquil waters and crawling along the ocean floor, making it a popular snorkelling location. Spot dart, moon wrasse, raccoon butteryfly fish, humbugs, western rock lobster and other crustaceans such as banded hair shrimp and beds of oysters, along with 10 types of sponge and 11 species of coral.\n\nWalk along the pristine sandy beach and examine rock pools along the shore. Swim in the sheltered waters and laze about on the soft sand. Then settle back after a rewarding investigation of the Blue Holes to see the beautiful Western Australian sunset.\n\nBlue Holes and Kalbarri are approximately 6 hours' drive north of Perth.\n\nThere are toilets onsite.",

Sit beneath it, and it feels as though you\u2019re in a natural spa. \n\nWhile it\u2019s most fun when the waves are crashing, the pool is still a beautiful spot to visit and take a dip when it\u2019s calm too.",

The 7.9 kilometre Top Trail has a single track suitable for both the novice and experienced rider. The trail can be shortened to about four kilometres by using the short course return route. It varies from narrow, challenging tracks with flat sections and hill climbs to true gravel roads, with the ball bearing like bauxite gravel making things pretty interesting for mountain biking.",

Towards the end of the season you may even be lucky enough to encounter turtle hatchlings as they emerge from their nest, making their way to the ocean to start their long journey to adulthood.\n\nGuided Turtle Eco-Education tours increase the chance of finding and observing nesting female turtles in the natural environment. Viewing nesting female turtles and hatchlings with a guide minimises your chance of disturbing them which will increase the chance of female turtles successfully laying eggs.",

The best way to appreciate the area is by taking a bush tucker tour with an Aboriginal guide. They teach you how to make a spear for fishing, after which you get to barbecue your catch.",

        "description": "For a scenic drive through towering timber forests, visit Boranup Karri Forest, located just south of Margaret River.\n\nPart of the Leeuwin-Naturaliste National Park, this area is famous for its vibrant wildflowers that blanket the forest floor in spring. Boranup Karri Forest is notable for being the westernmost region where the tall, pale-barked karri trees thrive, with some reaching heights of over 60 meters and covering the hilly landscapes.\n\nThe picturesque drive through the forest is accessible for conventional vehicles, allowing you to marvel at the enormous trees lining the road. A brief walk leads to Boranup Lookout, offering sweeping views of the forest and coastline. There are several picnic and barbecue spots available, along with a campground at the southern end of Boranup Drive.\n\nYou can easily access Boranup Forest from Caves Road, just a short drive south of Margaret River.",

Welcome to the Kennedy Range, a dramatic landscape shaped by ancient forces.\n\nThis vast sandstone plateau stretches between 12 and 25 km wide and 75 km long, rising 80 meters above the surrounding red earth plains. The range\u2019s geology tells a fascinating story, with rocks formed beneath an ancient sea. Keep an eye out for marine fossils embedded in the exposed rock.\n\nThe plateau\u2019s red sand dunes, shaped 20,000 years ago, are now covered with shrubland and spinifex grass. On the western side, spring-fed oases provide vital water for wildlife, especially in droughts, and hold cultural significance for the area\u2019s traditional owners.\n\nThe best way to explore this stunning landscape is on foot. Several trails lead you through the park\u2019s dramatic gorges, but be sure to check safety advice before setting out in this remote region.\n\nSpring is an ideal time to visit, when wildflowers like everlastings bloom, creating a striking contrast against the red earth. For stargazers, camping at Temple Gorge Campground offers breathtaking views of the night sky, where the vastness of the plateau seems small next to the infinite stars above. ",

Sand whiting and Australian herring can be seen in the open water.\n\nYou may also notice a few anemones growing within the pool, while cushion stars, abalone and other shellfish species hide in the rocky reef top.

It boasts calm, crystal clear water, with waves averaging just over 1 metre along the beach. The safest swimming spots are the southern lagoon beach and the south end of the main lagoon.\n\nCast a line or grab your snorkel and experience the beautiful Yanchep Lagoon. Beach fishing is a popular activity at Yanchep Lagoon and Yanchep Beach to the north. During the permissible and license season, abalone fishing is also a popular activity for locals and visitors to Yanchep Lagoon and Fisherman\u2019s Hollow to the south. \n\nWhen abalone fishing, ensure you know catch limits, wear appropriate clothing, check the conditions on the day and swim with a friend. Although Yanchep Lagoon may appear safe, be aware of strong currents and waves washing over the reef when collecting abalone.\n\nPlease note that swimmers should swim between the flags and be cautious of the strong current which flows out of the lagoon into deeper water. If you are caught in a rip, stay calm, raise your hand and await rescue. Fishing is not permitted between the red and yellow flags and spearfishing is prohibited at all times.",
