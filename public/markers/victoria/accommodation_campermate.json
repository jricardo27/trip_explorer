The lake is made up of 1,700 hectares of significant wetlands and stony rises right next to the historic lava flows of Budj Bim National Park. The Gunditjmara people have sustained life here for tens of thousands of years, and created what is considered to be one of Australia's earliest and largest aquaculture systems. \n\nThe tour starts with a look at the kooyang (eel) holding tank and an overview of their habitat and lifecycle. Walk along the boardwalk and out onto the jetty over the lake, where your guide will give you an overview of the Gunditjmara creation story and point out the extensive marine and bird-life of the lake.",

There are rocks to clamber, cliffs to jump from and a giant rope swing for flips.\n\nLaze about on the lake's pebbly beach. It is quite exposed so remember to sunscreen up.\n\nThere is a free campsite 500m from the Blue Pool with 30 sites, drop toilets and fire pits. It is basic and not suitable for large trailers.",

There are a few walking tracks in the area, including a short walk to the base of the falls. The walks are mostly easy and are suitable for all ages.

It has a focal plane of 30 meters and a range of 27 nautical miles. The lighthouse was automated in 1954 and the last lighthouse keeper left the island in 1960.

It has a black lantern room on top that houses a powerful light that can be seen for up to 30 nautical miles. The lighthouse is also equipped with a siren that is used to warn ships of foggy conditions.",

Over time, the cavities filled with sand and sediment, which hardened into limestone tubes. The tubes are typically around 3 meters high, but some can be as tall as 20 meters.",

The track on the northern bank of the Ovens River has steep steps and may be difficult for people with limited mobility. The track on the southern bank from Howitt Park to Canyon Lane is sealed and wheelchair friendly (Grade 1). For a longer loop, continue past the two suspension bridges to the railway bridge and return along the Murray to Mountains Rail Trail.\n\nOtherwise, cross either of the suspension bridges to create a short or long loop. The short loop is easy and accessible for prams. Interpretive signs highlight the local gold mining history of this area. This walk takes you past a small canyon carved by the Ovens River and water races dug by early miners. Keep an eye out for birdlife and wildflowers especially in spring.\n\nGrade: Easy\nDistance: 3km\nTime: 1.5 hours, return",

Power reputedly befriended a young Ned Kelly before leading him into a life of crime from which there appeared to be no turning back. On the run from the law for 8 years, Power used the location of the reserve as a hideout and vantage point. Nevertheless, it was here that he was eventually captured by police.\n\nToday, Powers Lookout provides day visitors with a beautiful view of the King Valley, as well as opportunities to spot some of the area's iconic wildlife including Superb Lyrebirds and Wedge-Tailed Eagles.",

With its wide open landscapes, breathtaking sunsets and starry nights, its vastness and isolation will take more than a day to explore.\n\nThis is a great park for four wheel drive touring, bushwalking and camping.\n\nThe Pink Lakes are picturesque at most times of year, changing in colour from a deep pink to a glistening white. There are excellent walking tracks in the Pink Lakes area, along with a campground.\n\nA great walk to do is the Pink Lakes Trail. \n\nBegin at the Pink Lakes picnic area and discover why Victoria's second largest national park is so popular. Four of the park's lakes \u2013 Crosbie, Becking, Kenyon and Hardy \u2013 turn a vivid pink. This effect is caused by the release of a red pigment called carotene by algae in the water. The brilliant colour is best viewed at dawn, in the late afternoon or under a cloudy sky.\n\nThe huge flatlands of Murray-Sunset National Park also provide refuge for some unusual plants and animals. It is home to Victoria's largest flower, the Murray lily and Australia's rarest bird, the black-eared miner. Wander through this untouched wilderness and find a diversity of habitats, including Murray River billabongs, wetlands, woodlands, semiarid sand dunes and salt pans.",

A fee of $5 per person applies for use of the nine fairways. Golf clubs can be hired by prior arrangement; contact a volunteer using the provided mobile numbers.\nFacilities:\n\n- The campground offers toilets and is pet-friendly. However, dogs and cats must be restrained at all times. Pets that threaten native birds, animals, or grazing livestock will be banned.\n- A donation is requested per night, and a three-day stay limit applies. Visitors are reminded to close the gate due to sheep grazing throughout the year.\n- The reserve is accessible to RVs, camper trailers, caravans, and big rigs. \n- Tent camping is also allowed.\n- There is no potable water on the reserve; all water is bore water and not suitable for human consumption.\n- There are no rubbish bins, so please take your rubbish with you. Strictly No Fires at any time.\n- No Cutting or Removal of Wood. \n\nHawkesdale village has a Post Office with some general supplies available.",

        "description": "Water from an old gold dredge bucket dumps down on the children waiting below, hitting the ground with a 'splash'. Gleeful shrieks fill the air. Nearby, a father and son are drenching each other with water cannons. Water squirts from the ground as children dart through rings of spray glistening in the sunlight.\n\nSplayed out on the grass by the banks of the Ovens River are families picnicking, sunbaking, reading, and sleeping. Some swim in the river as the lifeguard watches on, edging as close to the dam wall as they can before the water cascades over. Water splashes as someone bombs from the springboard, and again as someone comes down the Rotary Slide. Under a small bridge, where Morses Creek meets the river, the smallest children wade in the shallows, filling buckets and cups and splashing about in their sunhats. It's little wonder the Bright Splash Park and River Pool has become a summertime favourite for families.\n\nSet within Centenary Park and close to the cafes and eateries of the town centre, the Splash Park and River Pool has easy access to gas BBQs and picnic tables. A large children's playground, drinking water and public toilets are located in the adjoining Howitt Park.\n\nBest of all, it's free!\n\nThe Splash Park and River Pool are officially open in the warmer months of the year when a lifeguard is on duty. The season generally runs up to the Easter long weekend before the splash park is switched off for winter when the river runs cold and fast.\n\nThe splash park uses a single-use water system that draws water from a bore and requires no chemical treatment. Used water is drained into the river, adding to the natural flows.",

Meals were reasonably priced and they were absolutely HUGE!\n\nAfter we\u2019d eaten we browsed the memorabilia on the walls and ceiling (!!) of the pub. There\u2019s business cards, stubbie coolers, shirts and plenty of photos of local characters from over the years adorning just about every available space.

The canteen is even open for breakfast on weekends! \r\n\r\nBrewery tours are hosted daily, so jump aboard and learn more about how that delicious beer makes its way from brewery to bottle.\r\n\r\nFor the true beer enthusiast, White Rabbit Barrel Hall shares the same site and their range of beer is true to their philosophy of fermentation with imagination.",
