At the end of the famous Birdsville Track, and situated on the eastern edge of the Simpson Desert, Birdsville is surrounded by the vast gibber plains of Sturt's Stony Desert and rich Channel Country.\n\nWirrarri (the first nation word for Birdsville) has been inhabited for thousands of years by the Yarluyandi, and is now part of the Wangkangurru Yarluyandi Native Title area. In more recent history, white settlers started the town as a rest stop and watering hole for cattle drovers moving their stock. Today, it\u2019s a thriving community where visitors to outback Queensland can enjoy a cold beer at the iconic Birdsville Hotel, back a winner at the world-renowned Birdsville Races as part of the Simpson Desert Racing Carnival, enjoy the amazing music of international artists at the Big Red Bash music festival, or simply relax whilst watching the thousands of birds that inhabit the local waterhole.\n\nThere is plenty to keep you occupied in and around Birdsville. Watch the sun set over Big Red, the tallest sand dune in the Simpson Desert. History buffs will get a kick out of seeing one of the Bourke and Wills scar trees on the banks of the Diamantina River. Soend an unforgettable day with family and friends at the Birdsville Billabong, where birdlife, fish, yabbies, and marsupials abound. Or visit the Wirrarri Visitor Information Centre, where the small museum gives insights into living in this remote place.\n\n## Sensory Audio Guides\n[Wirrarri (Birdsville) Audio Guide](https://www.australianvisitorcentresapp.com/wirrarri-audio-guide)",

The waters at Tannum Beach are so mild; you can take a dip virtually any time of year. Take a boat trip out to Wild Cattle Island, a habitat of endangered birds and turtles. \n\nBoyne Island, surrounded by the Boyne River, is perfect for fishing and water skiing. If you'd rather stay on dry land, Turtle Way is a 15 kilometre riverfront walking track.",

Some beachfront sites provide water but do not have sullage; please check availability when booking as you may need to bring a bucket to collect sullage, which can be emptied into our sullage trap. All beachfront sites have power but no water or sullage. For guests seeking full caravan facilities, we recommend reserving a non-beachfront site.\n\nOur campground is shaded by beautiful trees, but please be aware that limbs may fall at any time due to natural events. Management accepts no responsibility for damage caused by fallen branches or other \"acts of nature.\" Guests are advised to ensure their property is adequately insured during their stay.\n\nThe region is famous for its world-class reef fishing, making it an ideal destination for anglers.\n\nNamed after Captain James Cook's second landing on May 24, 1770, the town of 1770 offers a peaceful, laid-back atmosphere. While the nearest shopping facilities are 7 km away in Agnes Water, basic groceries are available at our camp kiosk for your convenience.\n\nEnjoy the beauty of our beachfront, spectacular fishing, and unforgettable sunsets!",

        "description": "The Charleville Bilby Experience offers a must-see show! Join a tour of our nocturnal house (where we alter the timing so that the bilby\u2019s night is during our day) and see some super cute bilbies during their night-time activities. After an engaging talk by one of our keepers you will understand more about the plight of this delightful eco-engineer and exactly why they are worth saving from extinction.\n\nThe Save the Bilby Fund has been working hard on the breeding facility here in Charleville and we have produced over 50 babies in the last couple of years. Our management of the pairings (ensuring genetic diversity) means that we are helping build up the bilby populations across Australia with the intent of insuring them against extinction. \n\nProtecting bilbies and their environments mean that many many other native Australian species (some not as cute as our bilbies!) will also be saved.",

But our caravan park and accommodations are more than just dog-friendly. \n\nWe have created a home away from home where four-legged friends can enjoy our amenities, including dedicated dog facilities and training centre, while you immerse yourself in the tranquility of our spacious sites, which offer panoramic mountain views, creating an ideal setting for relaxation. Or indulge in the luxury of our cottages and houses, where stunning vistas extend from Agnes to the ocean.\n\nAt The Summit 1770 we have different site options to suit all requirements. We cater for caravans large and small, motorhomes, buses, vans, camper trailers, rooftop tents, plus camping in cars, tents and swags.\n\nWe have sites with concrete slabs, power and water and plenty of room with no one in front or behind you, and 7 metres between you and your neighbour. We have grass sites, with power and water that can be used for caravans, tents or swags.\n\nIf you prefer an unpowered site, these are also available, a little further away from the amenities and some levelling may be needed, depending on your setup.\n\nMUST check in by 5pm!",

Changing water flows made the old site of little use. Groper Creek was just a tidal inlet until the floods of 1918 made it one of the mouths of the the Burdekin River, one of the largest river systems in Queensland.",

        "description": "Welcome to Cunnamulla Caravan & Tourist Park, the only outback park with an absolute water frontage! The Warrego Riverside Tourist Park Cunnamulla in the Paroo Shire is a priority stop on many a traveller's itinerary.\n\nCunnamulla is well known as the home of the Cunnamulla Fella and \"the gateway to the outback\". Please bookmark this site or add it to your favourites now so you can check back later when you can.\n\nLocated 3 kilometers. From Town situated on the beautiful Warrego River with extra-large powered sites, drive through access. Fantastic outback camp kitchen, bush camping, dump point excellent amenities and it's pet friendly.\n\nAbout Bush Camping:\nth such beautiful bush surrounding you there is nothing better than a quiet corner of the park or riverbank fireplace to setup for a night or three.\n\nThe river can even provide you with a little tucker, with fisher-men & women reeling out popular breeds like Murray Cod, Yella-belly (Golden Perch) and Australian Bass. With the right know-how, half an onion, a dob of butter and a squeeze of lemon you've got a gour-met meal fit for the landed gentry.\n\nIf fishing's not your cup of tea then town is just 2mins up the road, with butcher's, bakers and some great take aways. There's also a very handy bottleshop (off-license) on the same road as the park just on the edge of town.\n\n",

The sand blow is also a popular spot for sandboarding, tobogganing, and kite surfing.\n\nTo reach Carlo Sand Blow, visitors can take a 600-meter walk through rainforest from the Rainbow Beach Information Centre.

Set yourself up here and explore the surrounding area.\n\nSet up your tent, caravan, campervan or camper trailer in one of the shady sites and head off to explore the surrounding area. Drive and walk the beach or throw in a line and see if you can catch a fish for dinner.\n\nIf relaxation is more your goal, sit back and read a book in the shade of the coastal sheoaks and Moreton Bay ash.\n\nWhy Sarawak? The names of six camping areas on the Inskip Peninsula recall the area\u2019s past shipping history. This former navy minesweeper plied the coastline from Brisbane to Maryborough via Inskip weekly between 1949 and 1970. It brought supplies including drums of fuel and returned to Brisbane with sugar from Maryborough.\n\nCamping area features\nOpen camping area behind the foredunes. No formally defined sites.\n\nPlease note:\n\nCoastal trees provide dappled shade in most areas.\nA few camp sites offer views across the ocean towards K'gari (formerly Fraser Island), while other \u2018inland\u2019 sites provide shelter from the sun and prevailing ocean winds.\n4WD vehicles are strongly recommended as all tracks are sand.\nLocation: Behind the foredunes, off Inskip Point Road. This is the furthest camping area from the entrance of the recreation area.\nAlso see: Inskip Peninsula Recreation Area map (PDF, 1.9MB) and Sarawak West camping area map (PDF, 252KB).\n\nAccess: 4WD access via Inskip Point Road on sand tracks. No beach access for vehicles into or out of Sarawak West camping area.\n\nNumber of sites: Open area without separately defined sites.\nPlease note:\n\nOccupation of a camp site is on a \u2018first in, best placed\u2019 basis.\nReserving or roping off areas is not permitted.\nAll structures under a single camping permit must be in one place and no more than 3m apart.\nDon't spread your camp too far, so others can fit in too; rangers will ask you to move structures that have taken up an unreasonable amount of space.\nCamping more than 30 days is prohibited.\nCamp sites are suitable for: Tent camping beside a vehicle, off road camper trailers, campervans and caravans.\n\nCamp site surface: Grass and/or sand.\n\nFacilities: Hybrid toilet blocks are provided in this camping area.

        "description": "Located south-west of Ingham, Mount Fox was created by a violent volcanic explosion about 100000 years ago. In the explosion, a lava flow 10 metres thick spewed from the southern end of the crater and chunks of molten magma were thrown out of the volcano's vent.\n\nToday, the well formed crater, about 10 metres deep, is covered with sparse grasses and stunted trees amongst the eucalypt woodland environment. The pink and long-fruited bloodwoods are common in this area and vine thicket is found in a steep gully on the southern slopes.\n\nMount Fox's tussock grass slopes shelter a number of small animals. On a cool day in the winter months, skinks and other reptiles can be seen basking on the volcanic bombs. During the hot summer months, the grass provides protection from the sun and are ideal nesting places for ground-dwelling birds like the little button quail. After sunset, rufous bettongs (small wallaby-type mammals) emerge to feed on herbs and grasses. The large wing span of a wedge-tailed eagle can also be seen, as this bird of prey soars above the Mount Fox crater.",

It is located on the remains of a small basaltic volcano that was active over a million years ago. The lookout offers stunning views of the surrounding countryside, including the city of Bundaberg, the Bargara coastline, and the Fraser Island World Heritage Area. \n\nThe Hummock Lookout is also a significant Aboriginal cultural site. The Taribelang Bunda people, the traditional custodians of the land, called the Hummock \"Woongarra\", which means \"burning mountain\". They believed that the Hummock was a sacred place where the spirits of their ancestors lived. \n\nToday, the Hummock Lookout is a popular spot for picnics, walks, and birdwatching. It is also a great place to learn about the region's Aboriginal history and culture.",

        "description": "This circuit walk is in the Natural Bridge section of Springbrook National Park. Dominating the Gold Coast's western skyline, Springbrook's cool forests and mountain streams offer views of impressive landscapes and walks among subtropical and temperate rainforest, open eucalypt forest and montane heath. The park is part of the Gondwana Rainforests of Australia World Heritage Area.\n\nA sealed circuit track takes you through the forest, across Cave Creek and into the arched cave to witness the waterfall plunging from above. With long sets of stairs, it is easier to walk this circuit in a clockwise direction. Remember to check for Park Alerts in wet weather as some areas may be closed for visitor safety. The hoop pines that emerge through the thick greenery of the surrounding rainforest are living relics of the Jurassic Age\u2014the Age of the Conifers\u2014about 180 million years ago. These pines are 'living dinosaurs'\u2014they are among the most primitive of all conifers.\n\nNatural Bridge is very popular with walkers and bird lovers during the day. At night the cave comes alive with the tiny green lights of thousands of nocturnal glow-worms, and the silent wings of microbats. Glow-worms are visible year-round, their display is significantly reduced during the winter months.\n\nTo protect the glow-worms and maximise visitor safety, parts of Cave Creek are a restricted access area.\n\nVisit yourself or book a tour here to see more of the cave system.\n\nTaking place after dusk, the rainforest comes alive in the evening with the shuffle and stir of nocturnal animals. The Gold Coast glow worm tour is one of the top things to do in the Gold Coast taking guests on a gentle rainforest walk along well formed pathways to the magical Natural Bridge, home to glow worms.",

Outer sand bars create inshore lagoon areas popular with kite surfers on weekends. The beach is also popular for fishing, with many anglers bringing in decent catches to show off.",

It's where you'll find the Maheno shipwreck, the popular swimming spot known as Champagne Pools and the striking volcanic rock formation of Indian Head.\r\nThe beach itself is not a safe place to swim due to dangerous currents and a large shark population. It's also a landing strip for light aircraft so be sure to take care when you are cruising along the sand in your four wheel drive.",

Follow the markers and stay on the sandy track to protect the park\u2019s fragile vegetation. Wear a hat and sunscreen and take water. Note: sections of the walking track may be covered by water when the lake is full.\n\nExtensive lakes and wetlands make Lake Bindegolly ideal for birdwatching. At times thousands of waterbirds flock to the lake to feed and breed. Birds commonly seen on the lake include pelicans, swans and a variety of waders. Wedge-tailed eagles, blue bonnets, pink cockatoos and mulga parrots are birds of the shrublands. Watch for reptiles and for red and grey kangaroos which come to drink at the lakes.\n\nWalk rather than drive near the lakes and you will see more birds and preserve fragile ecosystems. A bird viewing site is 4.5km from the car park. Early mornings are best for seeing and photographing arid zone wildlife. See the description of the park's natural environment for more details about Lake Bindegolly\u2019s diverse wildlife.",

Nindigully was selected as the filming location by writer and director, Antony J Bowman. Bowman travelled through New South Wales and Queensland to locate the exact place where the story of Paperback Hero would unfold. \n\nTo honour the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the film\u2019s release, the iconic Boomerangs were brought back to life in 2019 with St George artist and descendant of Kamilaroi nations, Yuwulaaraary Euahlayi and Bigambul, Barry \u201cRainman\u201d Boland transformed the sculptures to their full glory.",

Hitching posts & horse troughs flanked the intersecting dirt tracks that are today's Marshall and Herbert Streets. \n\nA lot has changed since then, however we maintain the good old-fashioned hospitality we\u2019ve been known for, for decades.\n\nOperating as a pub since the 1920s, we've been intrinsically connected to the community ever since. Our menu is inspired by the surroundings of Goondiwindi and beyond and of course, our local suppliers. Boasting succulent steaks, fresh seafood, clean salads and all your pub favourites, we\u2019ve taken our menu to the next level with modern Australian twist on old classics.\n\nWhether you're stopping in for a meal, catching up for a drink, watching the game with mates, or celebrating a special event, we've got something for everyone at The Victoria Hotel.",

They are transferred from Government departments and the RSPCA.\n\nCooberrie Park also has a successful breeding program for Koalas and Cassowaries. \n\nJust by visiting you are supporting the wildlife of Central Queensland.",
