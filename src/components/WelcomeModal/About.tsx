        Trip Explorer is a simple application that enables users to select points of interest (POIs) from a curated list on a map and export them as a KML
        (Keyhole Markup Language) file.

        This file can be imported into an offline map such as Organic Maps in case you are travelling to a remote area with no phone coverage.

        In addition to selecting POIs, the application allows users to sort and categorize them, making it easy to plan trips in advance using each category
        as a daily itinerary.

        Selected POIs are saved locally, and the application does not require a frontend or backend server, running entirely in the user&#39;s browser.
