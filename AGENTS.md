# Agent Instructions

This repository contains a React and TypeScript project. Please adhere to the following guidelines when making changes:

## General Best Practices

*   Follow standard software engineering best practices.
*   Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.
*   Ensure all tests pass before submitting changes.

## TypeScript and React Specifics

*   **No Semicolons:** Do not use semicolons at the end of statements.
*   **Type Annotations:** Always use type annotations for variables, function parameters, and return types.
*   **Avoid `any`:** Do not use `any` as a type annotation. Strive for more specific types whenever possible. If you must use `any`, provide a comment explaining why.
*   **React Best Practices:** Follow standard React best practices, such as using functional components with hooks where appropriate.

## Comments

*   **Minimal Comments:** Keep comments to a minimum. Code should be self-documenting as much as possible.
*   **Focus on "What" and "Why", not "How":** Comments should explain *what* the code is doing or *why* a particular approach was taken, if it's not obvious. Avoid comments that merely describe *how* the code works, as this should be clear from the code itself.
*   **No Agent Action Comments:** Do not include comments that document your actions as an agent (e.g., "Agent added this function").
*   **No Import Comments:** Comments on import statements are generally not necessary.

## Testing
*   Write unit tests for all new features and bug fixes.
*   Ensure all tests pass before submitting changes.

By following these guidelines, we can maintain a high-quality and consistent codebase.
